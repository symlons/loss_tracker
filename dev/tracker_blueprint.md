# paradigm: store as much data as possible, we can remove the data later if we don't need it anymore

# parameter view:
# store all hyperparameters, and use parallel diagramm to search for optimal one

# add drill down and roll up visualizations for hyperparameters   

# get rough data overview


# how to keep track of dashboard view across new 

# when establishing socket conneciton allow to choose between:
